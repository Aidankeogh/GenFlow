Machine learning on rat genes


## This project uses hydra, the main entrypoint is training_pipeline.py

# To run the default example, run `python training_pipeline.py` from the root directory.

# For an example running a custom config, try `python training_pipeline.py --config-name=optuna_test`, which runs config/optuna_test.yaml
